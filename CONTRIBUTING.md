## Introduction

Welcome to the Enhanced Prior Authorization System project! We're building a next-generation healthcare solution that transforms medication approval processes through Generative AI. This document provides comprehensive guidelines for contributing to our project while maintaining strict healthcare compliance and security standards.

### Code of Conduct
All contributors must adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which emphasizes healthcare ethics and professional behavior in handling sensitive medical information.

### HIPAA Compliance
This project handles Protected Health Information (PHI) and must maintain strict HIPAA compliance. All contributions must align with HIPAA security rules and privacy standards.

## Getting Started

### Secure Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd enhanced-prior-auth

# Configure secure environment
cp .env.example .env
gpg --import security/keys/*.gpg

# Start secure development environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.secure.yml up -d

# Install dependencies with security audit
npm ci --audit
npm run security-check
```

### Required Dependencies
- Node.js 18.x LTS
- Java Development Kit 17 LTS
- Python 3.11+
- Docker 24+
- Git with GPG signing configured

### Local Development
- Use mock PHI data for development (available in `./test/mock-data`)
- Never use real patient data in development
- Enable all security tools and linters
- Configure IDE for secure coding practices

## Development Workflow

### Branch Naming Convention
```
<type>/<ticket-number>-<brief-description>
Example: feature/EPA-123-hipaa-compliant-feature
```

Types:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `security/` - Security updates
- `compliance/` - Compliance updates
- `docs/` - Documentation changes

### Commit Messages
- Sign all commits with GPG
- Follow conventional commits format
- Reference JIRA tickets
- Indicate security/compliance changes

Example:
```bash
git commit -S -m 'feat(security): implement PHI encryption module

- Add AES-256 encryption for PHI data
- Implement key rotation mechanism
- Add HIPAA compliance logging

Refs: EPA-123'
```

### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement changes following security guidelines
3. Run all compliance checks:
```bash
npm run test:hipaa
npm run test:security
npm run test:phi
npm run compliance:check
npm run audit:full
```
4. Submit PR with security/compliance checklist completed
5. Obtain reviews from:
   - Security team
   - Compliance officer
   - Technical lead
6. Address all security/compliance feedback
7. Pass all automated checks
8. Merge after approval
