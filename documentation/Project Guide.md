# Project Guide

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The Enhanced Prior Authorization System is a next-generation healthcare solution leveraging Generative AI to transform medication approval processes. The system automates clinical documentation analysis, criteria matching, and decision support to reduce authorization processing time from days to minutes while maintaining high accuracy and compliance standards.

Key features include:
- AI-powered automated PA request processing
- Intelligent form management and clinical criteria matching
- Multi-stakeholder communication and real-time status tracking
- Secure integration with EHR systems, pharmacy platforms, and insurance/PBM infrastructure
- Comprehensive analytics and compliance reporting
