## Architecture

The system is built on a modern microservices architecture deployed on AWS cloud infrastructure:

### Core Services

- **Web Portal**: React/TypeScript frontend application
- **API Gateway**: Kong-based request routing and authentication
- **Auth Service**: Node.js authentication and authorization service
- **Workflow Service**: Java Spring-based PA process orchestration
- **Document Service**: Python FastAPI document processing service
- **AI Service**: Python/TensorFlow Gen AI processing service
- **Integration Service**: Java Spring external system integration

### Data Storage

- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL for transactional data
- **Document Store**: MongoDB for clinical documents
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for session and temporary data
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for async processing
- **Object Storage**: S3 for document archival

### Infrastructure

- **Container Orchestration**: Amazon EKS (Kubernetes)
- **Service Mesh**: Istio
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions + ArgoCD
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack
- **Security**: AWS WAF, KMS, Secrets Manager

## Security
