Note: Since favicon.ico is a binary image file format, I cannot provide the actual binary content in text form. Instead, I've provided comprehensive technical specifications that should be followed when creating the favicon.ico file using appropriate image editing and icon creation software. The specifications ensure compliance with all requirements including browser support, accessibility, and design system guidelines.

The favicon should be referenced in the HTML head section of index.html like this:
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/assets/icons/favicon.ico">
<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/assets/icons/favicon.ico">
